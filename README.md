# Predictive-Analysis-of-Refrigerator-Energy-Consumption-Data

This project predicts the annual energy consumption of different refrigerator models. We have applied linear regression and random effects regression with interaction term to the multi level data to get high accuracy prediction. We have initially done the data cleaning and EDA and accordingly split the data into two parts: refrigerators dataset and wine chillers dataset and applied models to both the data accordingly.After applying the models we have conducted hypothesis testing and found actionable insights.
